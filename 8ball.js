// define a variable called userName that is set to an empty string.
let userName = '';

// create a ternary expression that decides what to do if the user enters a name or not.
userName ? console.log(`Hello, ${userName}!`) : console.log('Hello!')

// Create a variable named userQuestion. The value of the variable should be a string that is the question
const userQuestion = 'What is your question for the great magic ball?!'

// Write a console.log() for the userQuestion, stating what was asked. 
console.log(`${userName} asked: ${userQuestion}`)

var randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 8);
